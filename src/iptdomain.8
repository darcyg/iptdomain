.SH NAME
iptdomain \- Daemon for packet filtering based on domain names.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "iptdomain \fIacl-file ...\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBiptdomain\fR filtering daemon is a \fInetfilter queue
handler\fR that checks the domain names present in certain HTTP and
SSL packets against a database of "prohibited" domains.

The database is built from the given collection of access control list
files (acl-file), where each file is dealt with on a line by line
basis: each line that starts with a period is taken to hold a domain
name to block as its first token, with optional commentary text
following. The following illustrates the format of an acl file:

 \.apple.com
 \.microsoft.com
 debian.net
 \.google.com
 \.www.nsa.gov.edgekey.net
 \.akamaihd.net

Lines where the very first character is a period declare a domain to
be blocked. Thus, the example above would \fInot\fR include
"debian.net", since that line does not start with a period. Basically,
those other lines are ignored, and so is text following the domain
names.

Note that the acl file format is ameniable to the
.URL www.squidblacklist.org Squidblacklist.org
blacklists, which are loadable without pre processing.

\fBiptdomain\fR is normally installed together with the control script
\fBiptdomainctl\fR and configuration directory tree under
\fI/etc/iptdomain\fR holding acl files.
See \fBiptdomainctl\fR for details.

.SS
.B Blocked domain name
All domains of the acl files are taken to be blocked, including all
their sub domains. For example, if an acl file declares ".acme.com" to
be blocked, then all domain names ending with that are blocked, e.g.
including ".www.acme.com".

The blocking applies to the domains and not the IP addresses. It is
effectuated by recognizing the "hello" packets of HTTP and SSL
traffic, and extracting their targeted server domains.

.SS
.B Domain \fI.domain.not.found\fI
\fBiptdomain\fR uses the invented domain name "domain.not.found" when
a targeted host is not found. This concerns HTTP request packets
without "Host:" header, and SSL \fIClientHello\fR messages without
\fIServer Name Indicator (SNI)\fR extension. You may include that
domain name in an acl file to prohibit all such traffic. This includes
SSL protocol versions before 3.3, and buggy SSL clients.

.SS
.B domain ".ip.address.found"
\fBiptdomain\fR uses the invented domain name "ip.address.found"
when the targeted host name appear as an IP address rather than domain
name. This is to allow for a blanket blocking of such traffic. This
applies to request packets for HTTP, and also for SSL
\fICLientHello\fR messages when the IP address is used as SNI.

.SS
.B limits
\fBiptdomain\fR is built to cope with a huge domain names database,
i.e., some millions of domain names. For example, if using all
Squidblacklist's acl files as of date, it would hold 1.7 million
blocked domain names.

When the database is large, the loading may take a couple of seconds
(if it's a slow machine). Internally the database is an ordered array
of domain names for initial name lookup, and a fixed size, single slot
hashtable cache of lookup verdicts, to speed up subsequent checks.

.SH CONFIGURATION

The use of \fBiptdomain\fR includes having one or more iptables rules
directing traffic to it. For example:

.RS
iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 99
.RE

The example rule directs all FORWARD tcp traffic to the filter, and
importantly, the rule will stop all FORWARD tcp traffic until the
filter is started.

Note that the filter uses queue number 99 by default.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.BR IPTDOMAIN_QUEUE
The environment variable \fBIPTDOMAIN_QUEUE\fR, if set to a decimal
number in ASCII, nominates the netfilter queue to use. Valid queue
numbers are 0 to 65535. The default value is 99.
