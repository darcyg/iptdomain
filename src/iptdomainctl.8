daemon.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBiptdomain\fR filtering daemon is a \fInetfilter queue
handler\fR that checks the domain names present in certain HTTP and SSL
connections against a database of "prohibited" domains.

\fBiptdomainctl\fR is a small and simple control script to manage the
firewall set up with respect to \fBiptdomain\fR.
.TP
.SS
.B start
The \fBstart\fR command installs iptables rules to direct traffic to
the \fBiptdomain\fR queue, and then it starts an \fBiptdomain\fR
daemon for performing the filtering. Note that network traffic gets
held up until the daemon has loaded its database.
.TP
.SS
.B stop
The \fBstop\fR command removes the installed iptables rules, and kills
the daemon.
.TP
.SS
.B reload
The \fBreload\fR command restarts the filtering daemon without
affecting the iptables rules.

Filtering is started by adding \fIiptables rules\fR to direct network
packets to \fINFQUEUE\fR 99, and to start an \fIiptdomain\fR daemon
that attaches to that queue.

You might want to edit the \fBiptdomainctl\fR to suite your firewall.
In particular, it is worth to note that when the queue rule matches,
the filtering decision is passed on to the \fBiptdomain\fR daemon,
which results in either ACCEPT or DROP.
